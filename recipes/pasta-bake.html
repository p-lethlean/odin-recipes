        One of my favorite midweek pasta bakes - my whole family loves it and there is not much prep. Once the pasta
        bake is in the oven, you can make a salad or set the table and then it's time to eat.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste </li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy whipping cream </li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar </li>
        <li>1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved </li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
        <li>1 small bunch fresh basil, finely chopped </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender
            yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of cooking water.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent while penne is
            cooking, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato
            paste and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan cheese and season with salt,
            pepper, and sugar.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Stir some pasta cooking water into the sauce and add cooked penne. Remove from heat and stir in cherry
            tomatoes, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, and basil. Pour penne mixture into the prepared baking dish and cover
            with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
